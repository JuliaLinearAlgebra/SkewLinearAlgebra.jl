# SkewLinearAlgebra

The `SkewLinearAlgebra` package provides specialized matrix types, optimized methods of `LinearAlgebra` functions, and a few entirely new functions for dealing with linear algebra on [skew-Hermitian matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-Hermitian_matrix), especially for the case of [real skew-symmetric matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix).

## Introduction

A skew-Hermitian matrix ``A`` is a square matrix that equals the negative of its conjugate-transpose: ``A=-\overline{A^{T}}=-A^{*}``, equivalent to `A == -A'` in Julia.  (In the real skew-symmetric case, this is simply ``A=-A^T``.)   Such matrices have special computational properties: orthogonal eigenvectors and purely imaginary eigenvalues, "skew-Cholesky" factorizations, and a relative of the determinant called the [Pfaffian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfaffian).

Although any skew-Hermitian matrix ``A`` can be transformed into a Hermitian matrix ``H=iA``, this transformation converts real matrices ``A`` into complex-Hermitian matrices ``H``, which entails at least a factor of two loss in performance and memory usage compared to the real case.   (And certain operations, like the Pfaffian, are *only* defined for the skew-symmetric case.)  `SkewLinearAlgebra` gives you access to the greater performance and functionality that are possible for purely real skew-symmetric matrices.

To achieve this `SkewLinearAlgebra` defines a new matrix type, [`SkewHermitian`](@ref SkewLinearAlgebra.SkewHermitian) (analogous to the [`LinearAlgebra.Hermitian`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.Hermitian) type in the Julia standard library) that gives you access to optimized methods and specialized functionality for skew-Hermitian matrices, especially in the real case.  It also provides a more specialized [`SkewHermTridiagonal`](@ref SkewLinearAlgebra.SkewHermTridiagonal) for skew-Hermitian tridiagonal matrices (analogous to the [`LinearAlgebra.SymTridiagonal`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.SymTridiagonal) type in the Julia standard library) .

## Quick start

Here is a simple example demonstrating some of the features of the `SkewLinearAlgebra` package.   See the manual chapters outlines above for the complete details and explanations:
